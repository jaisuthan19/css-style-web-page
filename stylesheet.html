		<p>Nature provides us all the natural resources. Nature always gives us something or nothing in return. It also provides us pure water to drink, pure air to breathe, food to eat, and other sources. Fruits and flowers enhance its beauty. Nature is the source of inspiration for many writers and poets. After spending a little time with nature, the man becomes relieved and loves it very much. Nature also keeps our health good. It gives us many medicines so that it is possible to treat severe diseases. Nature benefits us a lot.</p>
		<p>Man is harming nature day by day for his personal gain. He is forgetting that nature is precious. He has been cutting down trees day by day, reducing the beauty of nature and making him miserable. Due to human activities, the problem of global warming, etc. has increased. The nature that benefits us all the time, we are being harmed in return.</p>
		<p>If we want to explain nature in more simple words, then we will say that all those things which are alive and growing, that is, in this interpretation we include all the things found in our environment which help in the process of living and growing. Huh. Thus, nature means trees, plants and animals, land, air, water, forests, waterfalls, and deserts.</p>

			Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of the human activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system. Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts from nature. Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature. Escaping away in the nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul. Irrespective of what nature provides us it is also our moral and social responsibility to nurture nature.</p>
